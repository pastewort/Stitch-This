# Stitch-This
App to create cross-stitch or tapestry patterns

This code is free. It must remain free. It uses the Freeimage library.

It was created using Swift 3. I know. It's outdated now.

It works though - and does everything I need it to.

The Helpbook supplied with it should explain everything you need to know about running the app.

If you want to improve it, please feel free. 

By all means add your own credits etc., if you have made material improvements to the functionality
of this app.

I do require, however, that the content of the About page - including the dedication to my wife, 
and especially the statement concerning joining an Alpha Course, should remain in all future 
versions of the app. You could even try joining one yourself - and see where that takes you!
