<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3"><i><a name="resizing">Why reduce my image?</a></i></font></td>
<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">A:</font></td>
<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">Most image files stored on computers are many hundreds, or even thousands of pixels wide, but are rarely displayed at that resolution. Modern digital cameras can record pictures at resolutions of over 20 million pixels (&quot;megapixels&quot;). Since this app takes a picture and generates a pattern from one stitch per pixel, it might take several lifetimes and an enormous and expensive canvas to complete it at the original resolution. If your chosen fabric is fairly typical, it would probably be 14 or 18 stitches per inch. Not resizing your image will result in a massive and very time-consuming project.<br><br>
Each full page of printed output represents 7,000 stitches - and a seasoned and dedicated needleworker, putting in maybe a couple of hours a day (perhaps more at weekends), might complete one page in three or four weeks. So a project with 30 pages of output might take upwards of 2&#189; years to complete. If you are that dedicated (and frankly, we are!), that&apos;s not an issue, but you still need to reduce the original to around 300 x 700 for an image in that &apos;ballpark&apos;. Anything larger will likely be impractical. That&apos;s not to say that the app won&apos;t let you do that - you can go as large as you like, within reason. It will warn you, though.<br><br></font></td>

<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">Either you didn&apos;t change the height or width dimensions, or the cursor remained in the field when you clicked Reduce.

<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">This control locks the image&apos;s width and height dimensions together, so that if you enter a different value against one, the app will automatically recalculate the other, so as to retain the image&apos;s width-to-height (&quot;aspect&quot;) ratio. You can &apos;unlock&apos;, but then changing just one dimension will only change that one, and clicking Reduce will stretch or shrink the image on that one dimension. You have to press return or leave the size field before the Reduce will work.<br><br></font></td>

<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">A:</font></td>
<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">After reducing, the second image has the best 256 or less colours. You then opt to match to a preferred number of colours from your chosen thread-range. Some colours in the image may be quite close to one another, and the matching process could assign more than one shade to the same thread. Therefore, you won&apos;t get exactly the number of colours you entered - invariably less.<br>Also, to make the project more workable, any colours for which there will be minimal numbers of stitches can be 'merged' to their nearest equivalents, to prevent having to needlessly buy skeins out of which you might only need a few stitches. Please see <b>Merge</b> in the Match process for further details.<br> <br><br></font></td>

<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">A:</font></td>
<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">When selecting symbols, or defining symbol sets, the app automatically removes any it considers to be easily confused. Therefore this shouldn&apos;t happen. If there are still some symbols which you find confusing, create your own symbol set (see <b>Preferences | Symbols</b>), where you can ensure that the symbols used are ones you would choose.<br><br></font></td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">A:</font></td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">As per the previous question, there are numerous symbols in the full set which could easily be confused - so for example, there are five black triangles on the first line. When working on a project, it&apos;s too easy to confuse one black triangle for another. So the app removes all the others from the pool of available symbols once you have chosen one. This will happen all the time you are defining your symbol sets.<br><br>However, if you remove a symbol from a set, it, and any like it, will return to the pool. Likewise, if you press <b>Clear</b>, and remove all symbols from the current set, all of those symbols and their &apos;similars&apos; will return to the pool.<br><br>Moreover, if you opt not to utilise a symbol set at all, and just allow the app to allocate them for you, it will still remove any &apos;similars&apos; when choosing each symbol - but not necessarily those that you personally find confusing. If you didn't like the symbol set preselected for your image, try clicking the <b>Default</b> entry in the user dropdown, and it should choose a different set for you.<br><br></font></td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">The output will use the 50 symbols from your set, and augment them with others from the pool.

                <font face="helvetica" size="3">When you&apos;re working on a project, you&apos;ll have lengths of unused thread - not every time you use a thread will you use an entire length; you&apos;ll often use part of a length now, and need to keep the remainder for the next time you&apos;ll be using that colour. If you&apos;re using stranded cotton, it usually consists of six strands, and when you cut a length off, you would normally separate off and work with perhaps two or three, leaving a length or two unused, but detached from the skein. A &apos;Thread Card&apos; is what the name suggests: a card on to which you can loop those lengths of thread (an &apos;Organiser&apos;, if you will). <br><br>The output Thread Cards are formatted with each colour a set distance apart, so that a conventional 2-hole holepunch [ISO 838] can be used to create holes evenly spaced along each side of the card.<br><br>It&apos;s recommended you laminate the card first. If you do, allow a small laminate margin (say, 3mm or &#8539; in.) all round to seal all the sides of the card. Once it has cooled and the edges sealed and suitably trimmed (you may wish to &apos;round&apos; the corners of the laminate - they can be quite sharp when cut), you can then punch the holes. Line up both punch-blades with the horizontal lines alongside each colour/symbol entry.<br><br>

<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">Colours on the Key Page and Thread Cards are sorted by &apos;luminance&apos; (darkest to lightest). Experience tells us that if you&apos;ve just cut off a length of thread you&apos;ve been working with, and you&apos;re looking for the right place on your Thread Card to hold it, you may not have its colour number to hand, but will know the symbol: it therefore makes sense to look for it by its lightness; both the colours and symbols are arranged by shade.<br><br>
    <center><img src="../gfx/Shoplist.png" width="85%"></center><br>
The Shopping List, however, is ordered by Thread No from your range - because virtually every stockist (local craft shop or online store) will arrange them by colour number. If you&apos;re looking to re-order threads when you&apos;re running low on a few, it&apos;s really handy having the list in colour number order, so you may want to keep hold of your Shopping List, even after you&apos;ve bought the initial supplies for your project.<br><br></font></td>

If you are one of them, you can log these via the Spares Manager.<br>
When generating the Shopping List, the app will flag any that have counts updated in the Spares Manager, so that you don&apos;t end up buying those colours when you&apos;re getting your project started.<br><br></font></td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">A:</font></td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">Much of colour reduction amounts to working out the closeness of shades and the amount of them, creating averages and utilising those. However, some methods use dithering - which is a process of visually creating a third colour by putting pixels of two separate shades alongside one another. From a distance, these can be just as effective.<br><br>

<center>

        <img src="../gfx/dithered.png" width="50%" height="200">
</center><br>
<font face="helvetica" size="3"
The above images are undithered (left) and dithered (right). The first has over 5,500 colours; the second has 28. You can see that the undithered image looks a little more blurred, but if you look around the edges of the unfocused brown area to the left of the bird in the dithered image, you can see clearly-defined dots.<br><br>

From a needlework point of view, dithering actually works rather well, since we are always putting stitches of one colour alongside another, and it can often create quite a pleasing blend without detracting from the overall appearance of the finished work.<br><br>
