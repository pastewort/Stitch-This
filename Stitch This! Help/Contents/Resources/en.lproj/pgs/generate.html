This tab contains all the choices used to shape the app&apos;s output.<br><br>

Most of these settings can be defined in <b><a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a></b> - so if any settings are not what you would choose, you can set them there, and those settings will persist each time you use the app, or until you change them again.<br><br>

<td valign="top"><font face="helvetica" size="3">Fabric, whether tapestry canvas or cross-stitch Aida, is rated by stitches-per-inch, also known as &apos;count&apos;. Standard tapestry canvas is usually 10 stitches per inch, or 10-count, and this will be the default if you chose to Match with Tapestry wools. Standard cross-stitch fabric (Aida) is usually 14-count. It is possible to find and work with much finer canvas, although it&apos;s worth examining before buying; you may find that 18 or 21-count is too fine either for your manual dexterity or eyesight.<br></font>

For cross-stitch, this might normally be two or three, but you may want to use more or less, depending on the canvas. This setting is used to help calculate the approximate number of skeins you will need. <br>N.B. This is not available for tapestry work, since the wool does not naturally separate into strands, and therefore this will pre-set itself to 1.

Each page of the chart is a graph of up to 100 x 70 squares, each containing an identifier of the corresponding colour. Normally this will be the symbols - as discussed in the <a href="symbols.html">Symbols</a> topic. If you select &apos;Colour&apos;, the grid will be displayed with the symbols overlaid on the colours they represent. For normal working, you would probably want B&amp;W.<br>

Here you can specify what height you want your thread organiser card(s) generated. The shipped default is 8 inches (20 cm). If you have a tin or other container you will use to keep your project together while working on it, you&apos;ll want thread cards that fit inside. Here you can specify how long these cards will be. If you plan on laminating them, which is a very good idea, make sure you allow at least ⅛ in (3 mm) on each side for the laminate to overlap the edge of the card, so as to seal the edges.

The <b>Save As</b> dialog will appear to enable you to specify where you want to store the output PDF. It will default to where the original image was found, but you can change that.<br>When finished, you can view or print the generated output from the Preview app (normally by double-clicking the file from Finder, unless you have PDF files associated with a different app).<br>
When printing,  be sure to leave the <b>Scale to fit</b> option checked; <i>the app generates oversized output</i>, to ensure the best possible print quality.<br>
Bear in mind that it may well take a few seconds per chart page to complete, depending on the complexity of symbols chosen (even longer if you chose colour output), so you may be waiting for the app to return for a while. Don&apos;t panic - it does display a progress bar, and will let you know when it&apos;s finished.
